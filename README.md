Beer is one of the most democratic and consumed drinks in the world. Not without reason, it is perfect for almost any situation, from happy hour to large wedding parties. üçª

The objective of this project will be to estimate a Machine Learning model using the Linear Regression technique to demonstrate the impacts of the variables provided in this dataset on beer consumption (Y). At the end of the project we will have a forecast model for the average consumption of beer according to the inputs of a set of variables (X's).

Project developing during linear regression course I and II.
